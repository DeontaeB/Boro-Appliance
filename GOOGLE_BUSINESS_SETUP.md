# Google Business Profile Setup Guide
## Critical for Ranking "Appliance Repair Near Me"

This is **THE MOST IMPORTANT** step to rank for local "near me" searches. Without a verified Google Business Profile, you won't appear in Google Maps or the Local Pack (top 3 results).

---

## Step 1: Create Your Google Business Profile

1. Go to: **https://business.google.com**
2. Sign in with your Google account (use a dedicated business Gmail if possible)
3. Click "Manage now" or "Add your business"
4. Search for "Boro Appliance Pros" to see if it already exists
5. If not found, click "Add your business to Google"

---

## Step 2: Enter Business Information

### Business Name
- **Boro Appliance Pros**
- DO NOT add keywords like "Appliance Repair" - Google will penalize you

### Business Category
- **Primary:** Appliance Repair Service
- **Secondary:** Appliance Store, Home Improvement Store

### Business Location
**IMPORTANT**: You have 3 options:

#### Option A: Service Area Business (SAB) - RECOMMENDED FOR YOU
- Select "I deliver goods and services to my customers"
- Hide your address from public
- Set service area: Murfreesboro, Smyrna, La Vergne, Eagleville, Christiana, Rutherford County
- **This is ideal if you don't have a storefront customers visit**

#### Option B: Physical Location
- If you have an office/shop customers can visit
- Enter full street address
- Must be a real, verifiable address (not a PO Box)

#### Option C: Hybrid
- Both a physical location AND service area
- Use if you have a shop but also do in-home service

### Contact Information
- **Phone:** (615) 379-9576
- **Website:** https://boroappliancepros.com
- **Booking URL:** https://boroappliancepros.com/booking

---

## Step 3: Verification

Google will verify your business by:

1. **Postcard** (5-7 days) - Most common
   - Google mails a postcard with a 5-digit code
   - Enter the code in your dashboard

2. **Phone/Email** (sometimes available)
   - Instant verification if eligible

3. **Video Verification** (rare)
   - If requested, film your business location

**DO NOT** try to verify if you're not legitimate - Google will permanently ban you.

## Step 6: Get Reviews (CRITICAL FOR RANKING)

Reviews are one of the TOP 3 ranking factors for local SEO.

### Strategy:
1. **Get your first 10 reviews ASAP**

2. **Respond to ALL reviews** within 24 hours
   - Thank positive reviewers
   - Address negative reviews professionally
   - Shows you care and boosts ranking

3. **Get consistent reviews** (aim for 2-3 per week)
   - Set up automated post-service review requests
   - Include review link in confirmation emails

### How to Get Your Review Link:
1. Go to your Google Business dashboard
2. Click "Get more reviews"
3. Copy your unique review link
4. Share it via text/email: "Thanks for choosing Boro Appliance Pros! We'd love your feedback: [LINK]"

## Additional Citations & Listings

Once your Google Business Profile is set up, add your business to these directories (NAP consistency is critical):

### High Priority:
1. **Yelp** - https://biz.yelp.com
2. **Facebook Business Page** - https://facebook.com/business
3. **Angie's List / Angi** - https://www.angi.com
4. **HomeAdvisor** - https://www.homeadvisor.com
5. **Thumbtack** - https://www.thumbtack.com

### Local Directories:
6. **Yellow Pages** - https://www.yellowpages.com
7. **Bing Places** - https://www.bingplaces.com
8. **Apple Maps** - https://mapsconnect.apple.com
9. **BBB** (Better Business Bureau) - https://www.bbb.org
10. **Nextdoor** - https://business.nextdoor.com

### NAP Consistency Rules:
**CRITICAL:** Your Name, Address, Phone must be IDENTICAL everywhere.

**Correct:**
- Boro Appliance Pros
- (615) 379-9576
- Murfreesboro, TN 37129

**Wrong (Don't do this):**
- Boro Appliance Pro (missing 's')
- 615-379-9576 (different format)
- Murfreesboro TN (missing comma)

Google uses NAP matching to verify legitimacy. Inconsistencies hurt your ranking.
